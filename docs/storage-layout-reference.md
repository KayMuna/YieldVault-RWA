# YieldVault Smart Contract Storage Layout Reference

**Version:** 2.0  
**Target:** Stellar Soroban (WASM)  
**Last Updated:** May 29, 2026

---

## 1. Storage Architecture Overview

YieldVault uses a **namespace-partitioned storage model** with explicit collision prevention. All contract state is organized into nine logical namespaces, each serving a distinct functional domain:

| Namespace ID | Name | Purpose | Scope |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| 0 | `Core` | Token, shares, assets, admin, strategy state | Vault fundamentals |
| 1 | `Governance` | DAO voting, proposals, multisig configuration | Governance operations |
| 2 | `User` | Share balances, deposits, per-user caps | User holdings |
| 3 | `Shipment` | RWA shipment tracking and status | Asset provenance |
| 4 | `Fee` | Protocol fees, treasury, fee accumulation | Revenue management |
| 5 | `Withdrawal` | Timelocks, queues, minimum deposit rules | Withdrawal mechanics |
| 6 | `Oracle` | Price oracle configuration, heartbeat | Price validation |
| 7 | `Emergency` | Dual-approver actions, emergency proposals | Critical operations |
| 8 | `Strategy` | Strategy whitelist, caps, risk thresholds | Strategy management |

### Storage Layer Separation

- **Proxy Storage** (`ProxyDataKey` enum, `upgrade.rs`)
  - Lives in unstructured storage alongside the proxy implementation
  - **Never overlaps** with vault instance storage (`DataKey` enum)
  - Protected by EIP-1967-style hashed slot constants

- **Vault Instance Storage** (`DataKey` enum, `lib.rs`)
  - Contains all protocol state variables
  - Organized into nine namespaces via `StorageNamespace` enum
  - Subject to upgrade migrations and version tracking

---

## 2. Proxy Storage Layout

The proxy contract maintains upgrade state using explicit numeric discriminators (0–4). These keys are **completely separate** from the vault's `DataKey` enum.

### ProxyDataKey Enum (upgrade.rs)

| Discriminator | Key Name | Type | Purpose | Slot Hash |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `Admin` | `Address` | Current proxy admin | `0xb531276...` |
| 1 | `Implementation` | `BytesN<32>` | Current WASM hash | `0x360894a...` |
| 2 | `Initialized` | `bool` | Initialization flag | (derived from `ProxyDataKey::Initialized`) |
| 3 | `PendingAdmin` | `Address` | Pending admin for two-step transfer | (derived) |
| 4 | `StorageVersion` | `u32` | Storage schema version for migrations | (derived) |

**Immutable Constants:**
```rust
pub const ADMIN_SLOT: [u8; 32] = [0xb5, 0x31, 0x27, 0x68, ...]; // keccak256("contract.proxy.admin") - 1
pub const IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT: [u8; 32] = [0x36, 0x08, 0x94, 0xa1, ...]; // keccak256("contract.proxy.implementation") - 1
```

```

---

## 4. Storage Key Collision Prevention

### 4.1 Namespace Isolation

Each `DataKey` variant is assigned to exactly one namespace via `StorageNamespace` enum (0–8). Soroban's `contracttype` macro encodes the enum discriminator in the storage key, ensuring variants in different enum values never collide.

### 4.2 Parameterized Key Encoding

Parameterized keys (e.g., `ShareBalance(Address)`) embed their parameter in the storage key hash:

```rust
// Soroban encodes as:
// storage_key = hash(variant_discriminator, Address)
env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::ShareBalance(user), &balance);
```

- Different `user` values produce different storage keys
- `ShareBalance(alice)` and `ShareBalance(bob)` are distinct slots
- Parameter types must be `#[contracttype]`-compatible

### 4.3 Proxy Storage Separation

`ProxyDataKey` uses explicit numeric discriminators (0–4) and stores in proxy-managed slots, which are **completely separate** from vault instance storage. The vault's `DataKey` enum cannot reuse these discriminators.

### 4.4 Registry Validation

The `storage_registry.rs` module provides runtime validation:

```rust
pub fn validate_registry_no_collisions(
    keys: &Vec<StorageKeyDescriptor>
) -> Result<(), Symbol>
```

All registered keys are tested at deployment to ensure no two keys share the same `(namespace, name)` pair.

---

## 5. Upgrade Safety Constraints

### 5.1 Safe Operations

✅ **Appending New State Variables:**
- Add new `DataKey` variant at the end of the enum
- Use unique discriminator (next available integer)
- Assign to appropriate namespace
- Initialize to sensible default in all code paths
- Must not affect existing storage slots

✅ **Adding New Parameterized Keys:**
- Create new enum variant with distinct name
- Parameterize by new or existing `#[contracttype]` struct
- Ensure parameter type encodes uniquely
- Test collision detection

✅ **Extending Struct Fields:**
- Only at **end of struct** (does not break binary layout)
- Must update all access paths to handle field presence
- Can initialize missing field as `default()` during first access
- Document migration path for nodes decoding old state

✅ **Changing Storage Version:**
- Increment `STORAGE_VERSION` constant
- Implement migration hook in `run_storage_migration()`
- Ensure forward and backward compatibility semantics

✅ **Modifying Parameter Types:**
- Only if new type can be decoded from old serialization
- Add version stamp to struct if unsure
- Test deserialization with legacy data

### 5.2 Forbidden Operations

❌ **Reordering DataKey Variants:**
- Changes discriminator values for existing keys
- Breaks deserialization of live storage
- **Always append, never reorder**

❌ **Deleting or Renaming Existing Variants:**
- Breaks access to live storage
- Must deprecate with warning instead
- Keep zombie variant marked `#[deprecated]`

❌ **Mutating Parameter Types:**
- Changes storage key hash
- Existing data becomes inaccessible under new key
- Requires explicit migration hook to copy data

❌ **Changing Field Order in Structs:**
- Breaks binary deserialization layout
- Only append new fields at the end

❌ **Reducing Numeric Type Capacity:**
- E.g., `i128` → `i64`: data loss
- E.g., `u32` → `u16`: overflow risk
- Always expand or maintain type size

---

## 6. Migration Patterns

### 6.1 Version-Gated Migration

Each upgrade runs `run_storage_migration()` to adapt state for the new contract version:

```rust
fn run_storage_migration(env: &Env, target_version: u32) -> Result<(), VaultError> {
    let current_version = get_storage_version(env);
    
    // Version 1 → 2: Example migration
    if current_version < 2 && target_version >= 2 {
        // Copy data from old key to new key (if needed)
        // Initialize new mandatory fields
        // Validate invariants
    }
    
    set_storage_version(env, target_version);
    Ok(())
}
```

### 6.2 Field Presence Patterns

When extending a struct, support both old and new shapes:

```rust
// During migration
if let Some(old_value) = env.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::OldField) {
    // Migrate old data
    env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::NewField, &migrated_value);
}

// In read paths
let value = env.storage().instance()
    .get(&DataKey::NewField)
    .or_else(|| default_value());  // Graceful fallback
```

### 6.3 Immutable Field Preservation

Never relocate or modify core identifiers:

```rust
// NEVER change:
TokenAsset        // Hardcoded contract instantiation
Admin             // Proxy-layer field
Initialized       // One-time setup flag
PauseReason enum  // Existing reason codes 0–6
```

---

## 7. Storage Namespace Audit Checklist

Before deploying contract upgrades, verify:

- [ ] All existing `DataKey` variants remain unchanged and ordered identically
- [ ] New variants appended at end of enum (no reordering)
- [ ] New variant has unique discriminator (≥ current max + 1)
- [ ] Assigned to appropriate `StorageNamespace`
- [ ] Parameterized keys use only `#[contracttype]` types
- [ ] No two keys map to same `(namespace, name)` pair
- [ ] `storage_registry.rs` updated with new keys
- [ ] Collision validation test passes
- [ ] All access paths initialize new fields with sensible defaults
- [ ] Migration hook (if needed) implemented and tested
- [ ] Storage version incremented (if schema changes)
- [ ] Backward compatibility preserved for reads
- [ ] Emergency unwind and data recovery tested

---

## 9. Critical Constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `STORAGE_VERSION` | 2 | Current schema version |
| `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` | 50 | Max items in paginated queries |
| `SHARE_PRICE_SCALE` | 1e18 | Decimal scaling for share price math |

| `ADMIN_SLOT` | `0xb531276...` | EIP-1967 proxy admin slot hash |

---

## 10. Appendix: Reserved and Deprecated Fields

| Key | Status | Reason | Replacement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IsPaused` | Deprecated | Redundant with `PauseReason` | Use `PauseReason` enum |
| `ShipmentByStatus(ShipmentStatus)` | Active | RWA provenance tracking | No replacement (core feature) |
| `BenjiStrategy` | Active | Legacy strategy; kept for compat | Use `Strategy` instead |

---

## 11. Governance Storage Transitions

**Governance Signer Migration (Active):**
- Old signers stored in `GovernanceConfig.previous_signers`
- New signers in `GovernanceConfig.signers`
- Migration window controlled by `migration_deadline`
- After deadline, only new signers are valid
- Migration finalized by `finalize_governance_migration()`

---

## 12. Example: Safe Schema Extension

**Scenario:** Add a new "vault insurance provider" address field.

**Safe Implementation:**

1. Add new `DataKey` variant:
```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    // ... existing variants ...
    InsuranceProvider,  // NEW: append at end
}
```

2. Update registry:
```rust
keys.push_back(scalar(StorageNamespace::Core, "InsuranceProvider"));
```

3. Initialize on upgrade:
```rust
fn run_storage_migration(env: &Env, target_version: u32) {
    if target_version >= 3 {
        env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::InsuranceProvider, &Address::default());
    }
}
```

4. Access with fallback:
```rust
fn insurance_provider(env: Env) -> Option<Address> {
    env.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::InsuranceProvider)
}
```

**Result:** Existing storage untouched. New field available for future business logic.

---

## 13. Example: Unsafe Schema Change (Do NOT Do)

**❌ Forbidden:** Reorder `DataKey` variants

```rust
// WRONG: Breaks all existing storage access
pub enum DataKey {
    State,             // Was 5th, now 1st → different discriminator
    TotalShares,       // Was 1st, now 2nd → different discriminator
    TotalAssets,       // Was 2nd, now 3rd → different discriminator
    // ...
}
```

**Why:** Discriminator changes mean `env.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::State)` now points to the wrong slot. The old `State` data is still in storage but unreachable. New contract can't read old balances.

**Correct Approach:** Add new variant at end, implement migration to copy data if semantics change.
